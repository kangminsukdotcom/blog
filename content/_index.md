Hey, I'm Kang. I'm super glad you are here.

- I work with my wife to publish a podcast, write books, and host workshops. We found a two-person publishing house called [Jagunbae](https://en.jagunbae.com/).
- From 2022 to 2023, for 18 months, my wife and I ran a vegan sandwich shop called [CHEESYLAZY](https://reviews.cheesylazy.com/) in Jeju, South Korea.
- I'm inspired by those who send unique messages through their creations. My blog, bread, and books are attempts to convey my authentic philosophy of life.
- I was born in Korea, but I lived two years in China (middle school) and eight years in the US (high school & college).
