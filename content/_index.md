# Minsuk Kang

- My wife and I found a publisher called [Jagunbae](https://en.jagunbae.com/). We host a podcast, write books, and organize workshops.
- From 2022 to 2023, for 18 months, my wife and I ran a vegan sandwich shop called [CHEESYLAZY](https://reviews.cheesylazy.com/) in Jeju, South Korea.
- I'm inspired by those who send unique messages through their creations. My writings, websites, and bread are attempts to convey my authentic philosophy of life.
- Online writing transformed my life. That's why I [organize personal blogging workshops](https://kangminsuk.com/blog/workshops/) to help others experience the same.
- I was born in Korea, but I lived two years in China (middle school) and eight years in the US (high school & college).
- I like to bookmark interesting tools, articles, podcasts, and videos. You can browse [all of my bookmarks here](https://links.kangminsuk.com/bookmarks/shared).
- I write short stories on [kangmins.uk](https://kangmins.uk).
- If you liked my work, you can support me on [here](https://buy.stripe.com/7sIeWh0Crbe67hS4gh). Thank you!
