* Artists work while critics complain. I have the utmost respect for those who are passionate about perfecting their creations.

* I look up to doers, not talkers. I'm not impressed by your Rolex either. That's why I get fascinated by the stories of entrepreneurs, chefs, and writers.

* As a restaurant owner, I hear tons of unwanted advice from random family members and guests. Not a single one of them has any experience running a restaurant, but all of them are so sure about their suggestions. I try my best to ignore what they say so that I can surround myself with great books and podcasts.
