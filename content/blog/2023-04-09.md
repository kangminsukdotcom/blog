[I've published every day](https://www.kangminsuk.com/blog/1/) this week. The work's been busy, but I still spent a couple hours before sleep to publish a new post.

I feel great that I'm actually writing instead of complaining about how I want to "create more instead of watching Netflix." At the same time, I'm a little worried this blog would only be seen as my personal diary.

What should the readers expect from this website? What would be the reason to subscribe to my writings? Do these questions even matter?

It's a conundrum. It's difficult to write without thinking about other people's opinions. I publish whatever I can think of but still want you to think I'm a smart guy sharing something useful.
