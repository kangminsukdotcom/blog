### B-Free & Hukky Shibaseki - The God Sun Symphony Group: Odyssey.1

A Korean hip-hop album that’s NOT about wearing a Rolex and driving a Bentley. Artists listen to B-Free when hipsters listen to Beenzino.

### Denzel Curry - KING OF THE MISCHIEVOUS SOUTH

With this album, Denzel Curry has become my favorite rapper.

### Jessica Pratt - Here in the Pitch

Play this album at night. Read books or meditate.

### Logic - Ultra 85

Ten years ago, Logic was my hero. I’m glad he’s still making great music.

### MICHELLE - Song About You Specifically

This album made me dance.

### Annika Kilkenny - Look Mom I Made It

The algorithm recommended this album, and the robot was right. I like her music.

### Charli XCX - Brat

Everyone says it’s the album of the year. Is it that good? I don’t know, but the melody won’t get out of my head.

### Fujii Kaze - Tiny Desk Concerts Japan

This is not an album. I’ve listened to Fujii Kaze’s Tiny Desk performance at least a hundred times. I’m not joking—I even memorized the lyrics.
