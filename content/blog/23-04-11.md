At [my restaurant](https://www.happycow.net/reviews/cheesylazy-jeju-295726), I meet two kinds of people: the ones who smile and those who never smile.

It's joyful to serve the first group of people. They're the reason why I love this job. When these visitors open the door, the space brightens instantly. I feel so lucky to have such guests at the restaurant every day.

Dealing with the second group of people is a bit tricky. These people treat restaurant workers like ordering machines. I say hello, thank you, and goodbye but no answers. The restaurant is often merely a prop for their Instagram. I try to be indifferent, but it's not that easy to be 100% positive.

I'd like to belong to the first group. Not only inside a restaurant but everywhere I meet strangers. Smiling has the power to make someone's day better. Why not use it?
