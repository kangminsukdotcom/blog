When writing college applications, I noticed that all universities preached the importance of critical thinking and problem-solving. I didn't even understand what those skills meant, but I hoped getting a bachelor's degree would help me to become an original thinker.

It's been six years since I graduated from college, and I'm still unsure if I can think critically to solve complex problems. Without a doubt, I've realized a bubble filled with similar people is possibly the worst environment to learn "how to think."
