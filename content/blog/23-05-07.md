As a Korean struggling to escape from NPCness, let me tell you how a Korean NPC thinks.

* Happiness lies in getting into med school and becoming a doctor.
* There is no "Korean Steve Jobs" because our education system obliterates creativity.
* If you become a government worker, your life is set because you're guaranteed a pension.
* Never trust Korean media. New York Times and CNN are the most trustworthy media in the world. 
* Waiting in line for hours to enter a trendy restaurant is solely for my pleasure(It's not for Instagram).
* Moving to Australia, Canada, or the US will solve my problems in Korea.
* K-pop has nothing to do with online propaganda.
* To get married, you need a stable job and apartment.
