When Tim Ferriss [interviewed](https://tim.blog/2023/05/11/bobby-hundreds/) Korean American artist Bobby Hundreds, Tim asked a stream of questions to find out why Korean entertainment is taking over the world. Tim was in search of a magic sauce, a concise explanation for the success of Parasite, Squid Game, and BTS.

To answer Tim's questions, Bobby laid out some Korean words like *[Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_(cultural))* and *[Nunchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunchi)* to represent distinct characteristics of Korean culture. Hearing Tim's excitement at these "exotic" words, I realized Koreanness is being defined by blue-check people outside Korea.

Trying to blanket the entire population of Korea with these meaningless terms is like claiming all Japanese still carry the samurai spirit. I don't want *Han* and *Nunchi* to be the next [*Ikigai*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) that has become a buzzword in countless self-help books. 

Brooding upon the success of Korean entertainment won't provide enlightening life lessons. The rise of Korean soft power is a complicated story that deserves more than "there's something different about Koreans."
