Maybe humans are not meant to live in a city of 10 million people. 

Last weekend, my wife and I visited Seoul for the first time in about a year. We were excited to see friends and eat great Mexican food(still haven't found a decent Mexican restaurant in Jeju).

Although we used to live in Seoul for years, I couldn't stop telling myself, "*There are so many people and ads.*" I was like a robot overwhelmed with processing thousands of faces and billboards.

Ads, especially the ones in subway stations, were selling *[hagwon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagwon)* courses, cosmetics, and plastic surgeries. These images were urging all to chase popular jobs and mimic perfect-looking celebrities.

Can you form original ideas after reading hundreds of ad copies every day? Is it even possible to be 100% immune to these messages?
