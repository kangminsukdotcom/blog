*Inspired by [Manuel’s post][1].*

Are you starting a blog? Then [email me][2] your domain name. I want to be your first reader.

I’ve run this website for more than three years. Sometimes my friends tell me they enjoy reading my posts. Most of the time, though, I can’t help but think no one actually cares about what I have to say.

“Most people don’t even read Hemingway. Why would anyone read my blog?” That question alone can tie my hands when I try to keep writing.

I no longer push myself to justify the hundreds of hours I’ve spent polishing my blog. I’ve stopped tracking visitors. I’ve given up on submitting my site to Hacker News, thinking someday my domain might appear on the front page. Now, all I want is to stay on schedule and publish at least one post a week. 

Running a personal blog is one of the purest art forms online. My favorite online writers code, write, edit, and publish—not because they’re launching another BuzzFeed, but because they want to share their values with the universe. And yes, it feels much better to write for people, not algorithms.

So here’s the deal: publish a post on your personal blog, then [email me][3] your website or RSS feed. I’ll quickly become a regular visitor. If I enjoy your writing, I will be the first one to support you on Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee. I’ll treat your posts like books. I’ll read them with the care you deserve.
