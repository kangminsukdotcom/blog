Be white in Korea, and you will be worshipped.

Try your best to look like a white person. Thousands of world-class surgeons are waiting to work on your face. Pay them.

Speak like a white person. Let the poor kids study in Korean. Use English to rule over them. Make sure they can’t understand you.

Stand with white people. Smile. Take pictures with them. Show off to others. They are staring. You are on the pulpit.

Eat fire noodle and say it’s spicy. Cry and chug milk. Entertain them. Be a clown once in a while.

Look down. Tell them living in Korea is a blessing. Stand still. Teach them "it's important to be yourself."
