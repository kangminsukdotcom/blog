All of these services are subscription-based and privacy-friendly.

[Mataroa](https://mataroa.blog/)

- The most affordable blogging platform on the web. Publish for free or pay $9 yearly for custom domain. Great support from the developer.

[Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/)
- Minimal blogging platform. For premium features like custom domain and analytics, pay $5 per month or $48 per year. Possibly the best choice if you're looking for a simple blog with some stylization options.

[Micro.Blog](https://micro.blog/)

- Imagine Mastodon + Blogging. The best choice if you're looking for a communal way of publishing both short and long form content. The platform has an active community of people who've escaped from big tech social media. Micro.blog offers two premium plans: $5 or $10 per month.

[Typora](https://typora.io/)

- My choice of markdown editor. I like its minimal design, features like focus mode, and customization options like different themes. To me, $15 price tag is reasonable(much cheaper than iA writer). If you're looking for a free option, there's [Marktext](https://www.marktext.cc/).

[Wormhole](https://wormhole.app/)

- Free end-to-end encrypted file sharing tool. Wormhole just works like magic.
