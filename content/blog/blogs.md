- Discovered [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev) and became fascinated with static websites.
- Learned how to deploy websites with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and Netlify.
- Tried several Hugo themes such as [No Style Please](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-nostyleplease/) and [Bear Cub](https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub).
