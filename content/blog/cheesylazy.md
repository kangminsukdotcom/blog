Since May 2022, my wife and I have been running CHEESYLAZY, a vegan sandwich shop in Jeju, South Korea.

### What's so special?
* We write a weekly newsletter on our [website](tab:https://cheesylazy.com/). We share recipes we developed and publish essays about our experience and philosophy. We've written over 80 posts and currently have about a hundred subscribers.
* We have fantastic reviews on all sites such as [Happy Cow](tab:https://www.happycow.net/reviews/cheesylazy-jeju-295726), [Google](tab:https://www.google.com/search?q=cheesylazy), [Naver](tab:https://naver.me/FFnBhbdL), and [Kakao](tab:https://place.map.kakao.com/1011404661).
* Our food is fresh and original. We bake our bread twice a day and make almost all the ingredients ourselves. For example, pickles, kombucha, mayonnaise, hot sauce, romesco sauce, tofu cheese, smoked cheese, parsley pesto, teriyaki sauce, and chili are all housemade.
* We aspire to be more than a restaurant. We're writing our first e-book titled "Too Small to Fail - How to Start a Small Restaurant." We're also planning on hosting a podcast to interview independent business owners in Jeju.
* We also update our [200 songs playlist](tab:https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEnNOs6dh8HmuTkrP5Hd0rUmdjOXXVdsS) on a daily basis.
