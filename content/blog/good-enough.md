I love discovering and using well-made apps like [Paper](https://paper.pro/) and [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/). But the more time I spend searching for *the best* app for a task, the more I realize that there are plenty of cheaper — and often free — alternatives that do the job just fine.

Lately, I’ve been moving away from profit-driven apps and turning to free or “good enough” software. And honestly, it’s been a huge relief. For one, I’ve stopped wasting hours looking for the perfect app. I’ve tried almost every writing tool out there, from [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) to [Author](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/author/id1457450144). Now I stick with free options like [CotEditor](https://coteditor.com/) and [MarkEdit](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/markedit/id1531836174), or an affordable app called [Simpletext](https://simpletext.app/). These apps are well-maintained, lightweight, and have all the features I actually use. I’m genuinely thankful to the developers who make and share them.

After deciding to cut back on subscriptions, I canceled [SetApp](https://setapp.com/) and started looking for alternatives. Below is a list of the best free or low-cost Mac apps I use almost every day. They may not be flashy, but they’re solid, reliable, and they get the job done.
