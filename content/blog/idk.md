[This website][1] is my growing list of “I don’t know.”

We often ask each other tough questions. Some people answer confidently, acting like they fully understand what’s happening in our world. But most of the time, my honest answer is, “I don’t know.”

People may act like they know everything, but reading a book or getting a degree doesn’t mean you understand a topic completely. Why not celebrate the spirit of idk? Saying “I don’t know” doesn’t mean you’re ignorant. “I don’t know” is a humble starting point for meaningful discussions. When you think about it, we can’t be sure about anything.
