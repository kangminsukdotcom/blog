I made another website called [Infamous Interview Questions](https://infamous-interview-questions.vercel.app).

Although I haven’t worked for a company in over four years, I still think about the time I prepared for interviews. I was as scared as my cat hearing the sound of a stranger knocking on our door. I imagined the interviewer would throw me a bunch of piercing questions that would push me toward the cliff. I thought my job was to prove the usefulness of my intelligence.

I couldn’t be more wrong. Most of the time, the interviewers were only interested in my skills on paper. “How good is your English?” “How good are you with Microsoft Excel?” “Can you write well?” “Do you know anything about social media marketing?” were the same generic questions that echoed throughout my days. Except for a few cases, I was left clueless as to why the person in front of me had not even cared to read my résumé.

I would never get a job again(I’m a terrible employee anyway), but I wonder what good interview questions are. I don’t think we can assess someone with painfully boring questions. How do we know if the other person isn’t lying or if their answers weren’t rehearsed? 

In the end, interviews are like conversations. The best ones break through boundaries set by automated responses. They bring out the candidate’s unique qualities—often forcing them to say, “I don’t know” or “I’m not sure.” 10 questions on my website are worth answering in that regard.
