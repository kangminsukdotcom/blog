I see tourists in Jeju struggling to find things to do. Most rely on ChatGPT or TripAdvisor and end up at the same crowded spots that locals avoid.

That's why my friends and I(we call ourselves Three Deers lol) met every week for months to create [the ultimate Jeju City guidebook](https://jejudeers.itch.io/jeju-city-like-a-local).

Who is this book for?

- Travelers exploring Jeju without a tour guide
- Food lovers looking for the best eats (vegan spots included)
- Visitors who would rather walk or use transit than rent a car
- Anyone in Jeju who wants to visit the stores, restaurants, and historic sites we love

A guidebook should save you hours of trial and error. This book comes as a Google Sheet, and  you can download as Excel or PDF. Also, every place has a direct Naver Map link for quick navigation.

[Check out the book](https://jejudeers.itch.io/jeju-city-like-a-local) and [let me know](https://letterbird.co/kang) if you have any questions. We hope this guidebook offers you a glimpse of Jeju we love.❤️
