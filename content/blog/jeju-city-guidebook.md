I see many tourists in Jeju City struggle to find things to do. Most follow ChatGPT or TripAdvisor and end up at the same crowded spots locals avoid.

My friends and I met every week for months to create [the ultimate Jeju City guide](https://jejudeers.itch.io/jeju-city-like-a-local).

Who is this book for?
	•	Travelers exploring Jeju without a tour guide
	•	Food lovers looking for the best eats (vegan spots included)
	•	Visitors who would rather walk or use transit than rent a car
	•	Anyone who wants to visit the stores, restaurants, and historic sites locals love

A good guidebook is a great investment; it saves you hours of trial and error. Ours comes as a Google Sheet, and  you can download as Excel or PDF. The book will always be on your phone. Also, every place has a direct Naver Map link for quick navigation.

[Check out the book](https://jejudeers.itch.io/jeju-city-like-a-local) and [let me know](https://letterbird.co/kang) if you have any questions. We hope this guidebook offers you a glimpse of the Jeju we love.❤️
