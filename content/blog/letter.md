Hello there. I’m dead. You are alive. I want to tell you a few things.

1. Whatever money I had, give it to my wife. If she’s dead, give everything to the kids who want to become artists. Donate my books to a library. Please don’t throw them away. That would haunt me, and I’ll burn forever in hell if you do that.
2. I had a wonderful life. I’m grateful for all my teachers, friends, and family. Without their help, my life would have stayed in darkness. I was extremely lucky, right? Most people are shit, but I stumbled upon the jewels.
3. It’s okay if my work didn’t amount to anything. I’m dead anyway. I don’t care anymore. I only wish I had invested 100% of my energy into my art. I was distracted. By many other stimulations. I always wanted a simple schedule. Read and write. All day. That was my dream.

Don’t worry. I’m not killing myself. This letter will constantly be updated alongside my aging.

Thank you for reading.
