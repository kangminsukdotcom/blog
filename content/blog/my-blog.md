Minimal styling, zero tracking or ads, and really fast.

I've spent hundreds of hours designing this blog. It's my best attempt to represent my soul. After I die, this project will still float in the vast space of the Internet.

Text matters most on this website. I wanted to ensure no visitor felt the need to turn on reader mode. I experimented with various background colors, font colors, content width, navigation menus, and font sizes to embody my love for the books [like these](https://mataroa.blog/images/cb612f94.webp).

Scrolling on my blog is designed to feel like flipping through old paperbacks written with a typewriter. That's why I purchased [a font](https://sangsangfont.com/shop_view?idx=123) that pays homage to one of the first commercially made Korean-English typewriters called [Clover](https://mataroa.blog/images/6b07e4e0.jpeg), manufactured in 1978.

I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to turn markdown files into a static website, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for hosting, and [Riku](https://riku.miso.town) to collect HTML responses. I also used [Font Face Observer](https://fontfaceobserver.com) for fast font loading, [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app) for search functionality, and [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) for collecting emails.

Websites like [budding.computer](https://budding.computer), [elliott.computer](https://elliott.computer), [sive.rs](https://sive.rs), [lente.dev](https://lente.dev/en/), and [gkeenan.co](https://gkeenan.co) inspired me to value functionality, aesthetics, and privacy. These sites provide an oasis on [today's enshittified, big-tech-dominant web](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys). I'm proud to be part of the gang of independent creators.
