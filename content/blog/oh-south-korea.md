Oh, South Korea

Its fertility rate the lowest,  
the suicide rate the highest.  
Drivers yelling,  
smokers spitting,  
students crying.

Fortunetellers thrive,  
while crowds worship messiahs with wigs.  
Presidents get impeached   
when dads finish the third bottle of soju.

Trees get cut,  
apartments rise,  
Americanos flow.  
Games are played,  
cameras roll,  
ideas torched.

Watch the kids dance and smile.  
Watch the idols born and burned.     
Watch the elected emperors  
flying business around the world.

Chant and chant.  
Celebrate and celebrate.  
Our ruler reigns again.
