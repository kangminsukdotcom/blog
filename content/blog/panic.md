Anxiety fills the void of my morning. I’m not sure where I’m going or what I’m feeling. I see no value in my surroundings.

I hear my feet rustling under the thick blanket. *I must go.* It’s time to walk outside and grasp the magic.

I check what others are doing. I sense what they’re thinking. I’m trapped inside the web. *Help me.* I cry out in my thoughts.

I’ve made things, but they no longer are my voice. Then I search for books, anything that might save my day. I see the stacks on black shelves. They watch as I order another one. *What am I*? I panic, pressed for time.

The light’s filtering in. I’m three steps from the end of this tunnel. This darkness doesn't bother me anymore. My eyes are closed, and I tell myself once again: I’ll read. I’ll read. I’ll read.
