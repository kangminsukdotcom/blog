title: I'm writing book reviews

I'll be publishing book reviews on this blog.

My review will be deeply personal. There won't be a 5-star rating or structural analysis. I'll only share what I think is inspirational and interesting about the story. Nothing special, just a man's attempt to have a real conversation with another writer.

I also hope this series to help me improve my information diet. Perusing books could be the best way to forget about the endless feed of entertainment on social media. 

Let me show you some candidates. It's actually a list of unread books waiting to be opened on my Kindle.

Email me if you have any recommendations. I'd also like to read non-fiction books, but finding one without fluff has been difficult. I recently realized reading short essays is much more effective for self-improvement. I could be wrong about this take.
