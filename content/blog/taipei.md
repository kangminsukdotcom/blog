I’ll be visiting Taipei this week from 11/14 to 11/22. This is my first time in Taiwan, and I’m super excited about the trip. Our plan is to eat cheap local food, tour libraries and bookstores, and walk around parks and mountains. All without smartphones.

My wife and I will be staying near Nanshijiao station. Let me know if you have any recommendations for us!
