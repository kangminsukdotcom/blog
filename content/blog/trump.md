I still remember the day Trump was first elected president. It was my final year studying abroad in the U.S., and I had transferred to a state university after realizing the absurdity of paying $52,000 annually for tuition at a private liberal arts college.

Fresh out of a community filled with liberal college students, I was perplexed by Trump’s impending presidency and felt compelled to align myself with those outraged by the election’s outcome. After reading the news for hours, I posted on Facebook, “Trump can never represent the wonderful people I’ve met in the U.S.” Then, I waited for a flood of likes to hit my notifications.

For me, not much changed after the election. I continued attending classes and writing essays. However, some friends told me that many classes at the liberal arts college were canceled because the students were too upset. Hearing stories of students weeping together in classes, I realized it had been the right decision to step out of that bubble and see that most people actually don’t care all that much.
