title: My new writing schedule for the rest of my life

I want to be a professional writer, which means I want to make sure that I’m capable of crafting stories that are well-worth your time.

To be honest, I’ve been distracted like a moth at night. While I wished to write beautiful stories, I’ve spent a significant portion of my energy into consuming news and TV shows. 

I need to transform my habit of following all kinds of trending content online. I enjoy publishing podcast, writing blog posts, and coding websites, but my days lack clear purpose. I feel like my life will stay the same after 10 years running on a treadmill. It’s time to wake up and face the truth. I must make a writing schedule and treat it like a sacred ritual.

Here’s my plan: I’ll publish a post on my [journal](https://kangminsuk.com/micro/) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/kangminsuk.com) every day. Most importantly, I’ll publish a short story every Sunday on this website. I’ll always give my best to ensure these stories are as good as the ones on papers.

No excuses. This schedule must be protected, no matter what.
