- I work with my wife to publish a podcast, write books, and host workshops. We found a two-person publishing house called [Jagunbae](https://micro.kangminsuk.com/jagunbae/).
- From 2022 to 2023, for 18 months, my wife and I ran a vegan sandwich shop called CHEESYLAZY in Jeju, South Korea.
- I'm inspired by those who send unique messages through their creations. I'd like my blog, bread, and (someday) books, to embody my authentic philosophy of life.
- I was born in Korea, but I lived two years in China (middle school) and eight years in the US (high school & college).
