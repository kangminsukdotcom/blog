It's difficult to say "democracy is working great" when elections feel like civil wars without guns.

I want to feel pure joy. Unmeddled, undisturbed, unpretentious feeling that fulfills without any external help.

Elon Musk’s fans say they love his first-principles approach, but they still won’t admit Bluesky’s UX is way better than X’s.

What’s your definition of success? Let me tell you mine:
- I get to spend most of my time reading and writing.
- I’ve helped my wife achieve her definition of success.
- I’ve maintained healthy relationships with my family and friends.
- I’ve avoided spending the last days of my life inside a hospital.
- People remember me as a kind person who tried his best to win and help others win.

Just some thoughts about the upcoming presidential election in South Korea:
– The candidates call each other “a monster,” and many of their followers think losing the election means the end of the country.
– Whoever becomes the next president, the other side of the political spectrum will likely try to impeach him again.
– The three major candidates all have the same slogan: “To the New Korea.” Ironically, these are people who’ve already had enough power to propose nationwide reform.
– The far-right strongly believes in election fraud, which means they won’t accept the result if their candidate loses.
– Many Korean voters casually say, “I won’t vote this time.” Seeing so many presidents end up in jail, it’s hard to blame them for losing faith in the system.
– Korea is facing serious issues, from the world’s lowest fertility rate to stagnant economic growth. It's funny how the candidates all propose investing heavily in AI to solve all kinds of social problems. Ask any AI developer in Korea, and they’ll tell you the country is far behind the U.S. and China.

What books will remain as "classics" when AI is capable of generating words with a human voice and unique style? Will people still want to write a book? What happens when humans can't discern the words of AI from the words of a human? What if readers acknowledge machine writers are funnier and smarter?

I worry the process of writing a draft and editing each word will become a noble hobby rather than a admirable work of art. Maybe the task of writers for the next 10 years should be about breaking rules and boundaries that no LLMs can imitate.

Jung-hoo Lee, Yunchan Lim, Heungmin Son. I feel a sense of accomplishment watching these Koreans succeed in the big leagues. I have zero personal connection to them. Still, it’s as if I’m wired to feel proud of their success—despite my discomfort with nationalism and Korean propaganda.

> One writes out of one thing only–one's own experience. Everything depends on how relentlessly one forces from this experience the last drop, sweet or bitter, it can possibly give. This is the only concern of the artist, to recreate out of the disorder of life that order which is art.

약 20년 전, 중국으로 유학을 떠날 때 많은 어른들은 말했다. "20년만 기다려봐. 중국이 이제 미국처럼 커진다니까." 20년이 지나고 보니 어느정도 맞는 말이다. 아직도 중국을 무시하는 사람들이 있지만, 조금만 자세히 들여다봐도 중국의 기술력은 이미 저 멀리 앞서있다. DJI, Bambu Lab, DeepSeek과 같은 회사들을 봐라. Made in China의 무게감은 이미 달라졌다.

"그래도 백종원은 사업 잘 하잖아"라는 말을 했다. 그런데 과연 백종원은 사업을 잘할까? 사업을 잘한다는 것이 뭐지. 많은 사람의 삶을 망가뜨리더라도 돈만 많이 벌면 되는 것인가. 스스로 방송인이 아니라고 하지만, 어쩌면 백종원은 뛰어난 방송인이지 존경할만한 경영자는 아닐지도 모른다.

According to their colleagues, Steve was an asshole, Tim is an asshole, Bill is an asshole, and Mark is an asshole. Is it necessary for one to be an asshole to be a successful CEO?

아침에 빵을 굽는 날이다. 오븐 소리가 난다. 저번에 오븐으로 보리굴비를 데워먹고 까먹고 트레이를 안 씻었다. 황급하게 설거지를 하고 빵을 굽는 중... 뒷정리를 잘해야하는데 이것 참 부끄럽구만.

빵이 잘 나오면 커피를 내려서 같이 먹어 볼 거다. 근데 빵이 식는 걸 기다릴 수 있을까... 커피 먼저 마실 수도 있다.

없애야 하는 것이 있다. 지켜야 하는 것이 있다. 가볍게 살아야 한다. 다 버려야 한다. 

허영심이 눈에 보일 때가 있다. 어떻게든 잘난 면을 드러내서 우울함을 꾹꾹 밀어 넣으려는 발악이 눈에 보일 정도로 클 때가 있다.
