<p>I believe in the art of persistence.</p>
<p>From now on, I&rsquo;ll be publishing every single day. Mostly in English, but occasionally in Korean. No overarching theme. Whatever jumps to my mind, I&rsquo;ll jot it down on this blog.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if the day&rsquo;s writing is god-awful. This project is for my own benefit. Without this system, I&rsquo;ll always find an excuse to lie on my bed and start doom-scrolling until my thumb hurts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to wake up and create. This is the change my heart demands.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow.</p>
