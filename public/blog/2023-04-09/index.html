  <p><a href="https://www.kangminsuk.com/blog/1/">I&rsquo;ve published every day</a> this week. The work&rsquo;s been busy, but I still spent a couple hours before sleep to publish a new post.</p>
<p>I feel great that I&rsquo;m actually writing instead of complaining about how I want to &ldquo;create more instead of watching Netflix.&rdquo; At the same time, I&rsquo;m a little worried this blog would only be seen as my personal diary.</p>
<p>What should the readers expect from this website? What would be the reason to subscribe to my writings? Do these questions even matter?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a conundrum. It&rsquo;s difficult to write without thinking about other people&rsquo;s opinions. I publish whatever I can think of but still want you to think I&rsquo;m a smart guy sharing something useful.</p>
