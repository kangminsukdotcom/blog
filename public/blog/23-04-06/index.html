  <p>This quote from John Green&rsquo;s <em>The Anthropocene Reviewed</em> resonated with me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I cry a lot because I miss people. I cry a lot because they die, and I can&rsquo;t stop them. They leave me, and I love them more. I&rsquo;m finding out as I&rsquo;m aging that I&rsquo;m in love with the world. - Maurice Sendak</p>

<p>My life&rsquo;s already successful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too lucky to have beautiful relationships with my wife, family, and friends. How about the customers who leave thank you notes at my restaurant? How about my two lovely cats sleeping next to me? The fact that you&rsquo;re reading this from all over the world is a miracle.</p>
<p>I need to make sure my mind doesn&rsquo;t fall into a nasty trap. It&rsquo;s so easy to dismiss the world&rsquo;s wonders. Once in a while, I need to look around. I&rsquo;m in love with this world.</p>
