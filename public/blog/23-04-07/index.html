  <p>Lots of self-help books love to talk about the importance of mastering one&rsquo;s craft. &ldquo;Find your niche and be the best&rdquo; might be the most general advice on the Internet.</p>
<p>What does &ldquo;best&rdquo; mean anyway? I&rsquo;m a restaurant owner and blogger. Do I have to be a world-famous restauranteur and writer to be considered successful? Or is becoming the country&rsquo;s favorite enough? How about the best in town? Being the most talented baker in my family wouldn&rsquo;t be satisfying, right?</p>
<p>Not everyone can be Serena Williams at their job. Metrics for success should feel manageable. It takes time, but knowing one&rsquo;s values might be the most rewarding endeavor.</p>
<p>Discovering the works of David Chang and Salman Rushdie should not make me feel small. No one&rsquo;s asking me to mimic their lives. My life&rsquo;s all set as long as I&rsquo;m curious, optimistic, and peaceful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to be called &ldquo;the best&rdquo; to be happy.</p>
