  <p>At <a href="https://www.happycow.net/reviews/cheesylazy-jeju-295726">my restaurant</a>, I meet two kinds of people: the ones who smile and those who never smile.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s joyful to serve the first group of people. They&rsquo;re the reason why I love this job. When these visitors open the door, the space brightens instantly. I feel so lucky to have such guests at the restaurant every day.</p>
<p>Dealing with the second group of people is a bit tricky. These people treat restaurant workers like ordering machines. I say hello, thank you, and goodbye but no answers. The restaurant is often merely a prop for their Instagram. I try to be indifferent, but it&rsquo;s not that easy to be 100% positive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to belong to the first group. Not only inside a restaurant but everywhere I meet strangers. Smiling has the power to make someone&rsquo;s day better. Why not use it?</p>
