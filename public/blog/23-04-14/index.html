<p>When I was looking for a job, I never thought I was capable of creating my own product. I could only imagine becoming a product manager at a fast-growing startup in Seoul.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only been three years, but my life&rsquo;s totally different from what I envisioned. I run a restaurant with my wife and serve sandwiches for a living. This change could sound like a downgrade from an office job, but we always tell each other we&rsquo;re the happiest couple on earth.</p>
<p>Every day, customers from all over the world visit our restaurant. Not because we have Michelin stars but because <a href="https://www.happycow.net/reviews/cheesylazy-jeju-295726">everything we serve is vegan</a>. Many of them express how hard it was to follow a vegan/vegetarian diet in Jeju and tell us their appreciation for what we&rsquo;re doing. When we hear this kind of customer feedback, we realize our business is creating a positive impact on our community.</p>
<p>In addition to running a restaurant, we also write a weekly newsletter on <a href="https://cheesylazy.com/">our website</a>. Here, we share our thoughts, recipes, and tips for free. The website is not just a hobby. As much as we care about serving great food, we care about creating high-quality content. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve published more than 80 posts in a year.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen people using our recipes for their restaurants or parties. We&rsquo;ve read heartfelt comments saying our writings inspired them to be more authentic to themselves. Through our website, we&rsquo;ve also met small business owners from all over the country. Even though these people have never visited our restaurant, we&rsquo;ve built meaningful relationships with them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing my part for humanity by making something wonderful.</p>
