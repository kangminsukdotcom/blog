<h1>WeVPN Is Gone</h1>

  <p>WeVPN just shut down its service. I&rsquo;ve been using the service for about a year, and I won&rsquo;t be able to get any refund for the rest of my 2-year subscription. Fortunately, the monthly subscription fee was less than $3, so I&rsquo;m not too shocked about the news.</p>
<p>A year ago, when looking for a paid VPN service, I searched &ldquo;the best VPN&rdquo; and read some recommendation articles(aka paid promotions). I didn&rsquo;t spend enough time researching the best quality and reliability. I only cared about comparing the prices of different services. I assumed all VPN companies provided similar features and never thought software could shut down without giving any clear explanations.</p>
<p>Clearly, I made a dumb mistake. I hope not, but I can&rsquo;t even be sure if WeVPN did anything malicious with the users&rsquo; data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve realized that I need to pay more attention to the longevity of the apps and software I subscribe to. It&rsquo;s essential to check whether the service updates its features frequently while listening to customer feedback. For instance, WeVPN&rsquo;s development had been stopped for a year. Not surprising. On the other hand, I trust <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a> because I can see that Herman, Bear Blog&rsquo;s founder, has been dedicated to his philosophy of <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/building-software-to-last-forever/">building the service to last forever</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to be up-to-date with every software. The easiest way to protect oneself from this kind of incident would be following individuals who&rsquo;re genuinely passionate about sharing quality information. For example, it&rsquo;s been helpful to follow <a href="https://theprivacydad.com/">The Privacy Dad</a> to learn more about online privacy. Thanks to him, I&rsquo;m now subscribed to a more reliable service.</p>
