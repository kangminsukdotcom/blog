  <p>I’ve been publishing a post every day for more than two weeks. Writing daily has been really fun, and I intend to continue this habit for at least a year(maybe until the day I die. Who knows?).</p>
<p>Every morning, when I wake up, I grab my phone immediately and reread the post I published the night before. With half-closed eyes, I fix a few words and then start brushing my teeth.</p>
<p>I enjoy the seemingly endless process of revising. Some might argue spending energy on the next post is wiser, but I can’t let go of my past writings. Even if no one’s reading, I revisit my old posts and start working on them.</p>
<p>More views are great, but better writings are more important. To me, revising is like cleaning a house. It’s the least I can do to welcome my guests.</p>
