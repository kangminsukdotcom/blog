  <p>My wife and I are living with two amazing cats. Zong-ka, in the first picture, is 10 years old. Ban-ban, in the second, is about 10 months old.</p>
<p>Watching Zong-ka and Ban-ban eating, playing, and sleeping is one of the greatest joys.</p>

<p>I had never raised a cat until I met my wife. When I first met Zong-ka in my wife&rsquo;s tiny studio, Zong-ka was so scared of me that he ran straight into the bathroom. I remember feeling terrible because I knew Zong-ka hated touching the water. Three years later, I wish I could say he loves me, but at least he doesn&rsquo;t hate me anymore. We&rsquo;re good friends.</p>
<p>7 months ago, I spotted Ban-ban crawling through a six-lane road near my house. I was waiting for a green light. As soon as I could go across, I ran to check on the cat, hiding under a bush on the edge of the road. She seemed unharmed. I slowly approached to hold her with two hands. I didn&rsquo;t have much time to think, but I was sure she would run away. However, she didn&rsquo;t even flinch. I hugged her tightly in my arms and walked fast to my house. That&rsquo;s how Ban-ban became a new member of our house.</p>
<p>All four of us fall asleep on the same bed. In the morning, we humans wake up to the sound of our cats. At night, the cats always wait by the door when we humans return home after long hours working at the restaurant. I never get tired of living with these two cats.</p>
