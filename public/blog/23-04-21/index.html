  <p>When Dad passed away, he left behind a lot of clothes. Most of them are really nice clothes from his favorite brand Bogner.</p>
<p>I wanted to keep them as much as possible. With Mom&rsquo;s help, I tried on all the clothes and brought many of them to my house.</p>
<p>His pants are a little too short, so I pretend they&rsquo;re ankle-length pants. Some sleeves are short, but I wear them as 3/4 sleeve jackets. The size is not perfect, but I still love how comfy they are. Dad certainly had great taste in clothing. In terms of fashion, he and I value nothing but practicality.</p>
<p>Inheriting Dad&rsquo;s collection has pushed me to believe in the importance of minimalism. I no longer think of buying more clothes. Seeing the aftermath of Dad&rsquo;s passing, I realized I don&rsquo;t want my future self to feel sorry about the stuff I&rsquo;ve accumulated.</p>
<p>Wearing Dad&rsquo;s clothes became my first step towards a simpler life.</p>
