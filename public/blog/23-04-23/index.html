  <p>I&rsquo;m really busy these days. I have to run a restaurant with my wife, publish a daily post here, and paint walls in a house we&rsquo;ll soon be moving into.</p>
<p>Our restaurant is closed on Sundays and Mondays, but I still have to spend the bulk of Mondays prepping ingredients. My wife and I have Sundays to take a break from work, but we&rsquo;ve decided to self-paint our new house. Ta-da. Sundays are now reserved for applying putty and sanding walls.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no time to waste. When I became obsessed with my daily routine, my time suddenly became way more precious.</p>
<p>Two years ago, when I quit my job as a marketing manager, I felt like I was drowning in too much free time. I could sleep as much as I wanted and learn whatever I enjoyed. However, I struggled to focus on a single task.</p>
<p>Although I had numerous ideas, like writing a blog and learning to bake, I couldn&rsquo;t sustain a habit of working on them. I was constantly distracted because I had too many options. I wasted so many hours because nothing forced me to be busy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wonderful to be busy. I&rsquo;m terrible at keeping track of to-do lists, but I&rsquo;m capable of following a simple schedule filled with meaningful work.</p>
