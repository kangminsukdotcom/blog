  <p>When I moved to the US, kids at my high school called me Jackie Chan, Ichiro, and Yao Ming. I always wanted to tell them, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Korean, not Chinese nor Japanese&rdquo; but couldn&rsquo;t really speak English at that time.</p>
<p>Maybe alienation forces people to think deeply about their individuality. Before I met people who were oblivious to Korean culture, I never imagined my Koreanness could be made fun of by someone else. The moment I realized my identity would stand out, I began asking many questions about my identity.</p>
<p>In Korea, most discussions about Korean identity revolve around nationalism and pessimism. That&rsquo;s why I find the works of Korean American artists like Lee Isaac Chung and Min Jin Lee refreshing.</p>
<p>Minari and Pachinko feel authentic because they are inspired by the writers&rsquo; understanding of their Korean identity. These stories are not about projecting perfect images of Korea. There&rsquo;s no political agenda. They grew up feeling different from others, and this experience became the creative engine for their crafts.</p>
