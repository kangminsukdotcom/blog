  <p>My wife and I had great conversations with our friends today. Like us, they&rsquo;re small business owners who want their work to reflect who they are. Whenever we meet, we never run out of stories to share.</p>
<p>After hearing about their concerns, projects, and plans, I was instantly motivated to jumpstart my ongoing tasks. My friends&rsquo; perspectives on maintaining and transforming business felt so valuable that I wished I could record the conversation.</p>
<p>When amazing conversations end, I get sad because I know I&rsquo;ll forget the details in a few days. It&rsquo;s a bummer that I rely on my faulty memories to rewind what I&rsquo;ve learned from the discussions. I wonder if recording conversations with other business owners and putting them out to the world would be a good idea.</p>
<p>What do you think? Does &ldquo;<a href="https://nav.al/productize-yourself">productize yourself</a>&rdquo; mean I should productize my interactions with friends? I&rsquo;m sure many more would benefit from listening to the talk between passionate business owners. At the same time, I could also miss opportunities to form authentic relationships. If I&rsquo;m speaking to a mic while staring at a friend, can I really say I&rsquo;m not being pretentious?</p>
