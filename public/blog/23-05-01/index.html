<h1>My Desire to Be Associated With Celebrities</h1>

<main data-pagefind-body>

  <p>Eight years ago, I saw Leonardo DiCaprio at an Italian restaurant in NYC. I was with my sister, and he was sitting right across from our table. He used a back door to enter the restaurant, so my sister and I were the only guests who knew the most famous actor in the world was eating pasta in the same space.</p>
<p>When he was leaving the restaurant, I stood up and asked him to take pictures with me. My voice was shaky, but he somehow understood what I wanted. We took about a minute to snap pictures then he left saying goodbye. Soon after he was gone, people flocked to our table asking &ldquo;Was that Leo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, I posted the pictures on Facebook and checked the comments and likes every five minutes. Since then, I must have told this story to dozens of friends. Although I often said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about celebrities,&rdquo; a desire to be associated with them was always inside me.</p>
<p>The longing to be associated with famous people seems like human nature. I always see people posting pictures with celebrities, visiting cafes owned by celebrities, and buying books by celebrities.</p>
<p>Arguably, the number of followers has become the most prevalent measurement of clout. Maybe it&rsquo;s becoming even harder to be totally indifferent to celebrities.</p>
<p><em>It was a difficult choice. I decided not to attach my photo with DiCaprio.</em></p>
