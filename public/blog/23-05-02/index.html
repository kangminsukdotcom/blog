  <p>In college, I majored in Asian Literature. For three and a half years, I spent many hours reading books from Palestine, Egypt, Japan, Taiwan. and Mainland China.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t know what attracted me to Literature. Although I dabbled in Geology, Physics, Psychology, Journalism, and Philosophy courses, I found reading fiction and analyzing it most fascinating.</p>
<p>I was a lucky kid who had unconditional support from my parents. I didn&rsquo;t worry about securing a job after graduation and didn&rsquo;t even consider applying to grad school to become a Literature professor. I dismissed people warning me I was &ldquo;paying a lot of money to be a Starbucks barista.&rdquo; When choosing courses, my main goal was to have fun as much as possible. That&rsquo;s why I never skipped a class.</p>
<p>What did I learn from studying Literature? Nothing special really. Attending college is unnecessary if you intend to read books and learn how to write. However, I have no regrets about immersing myself in the works of Soseki and Lu Xun. I&rsquo;m grateful for the professors who returned my essays loaded with pages of feedback. There&rsquo;s no way to find out if my expensive education was actually worth it. I can only say I wouldn&rsquo;t be the same person without the years I spent studying novels. I&rsquo;m happy with this answer.</p>
