  <p>My wife and I run a restaurant together, hang out with friends together, and write a newsletter together. Our relationship is the most remarkable quality of my life. We literally spend 24/7 with each other and rarely have a serious argument.</p>
<p>Some thoughts about our relationship&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>We don&rsquo;t hide anything. I don&rsquo;t hold in farts in front of my wife. I just let them out like I&rsquo;m alone. Freedom of speech is guaranteed as well. We say whatever we think it&rsquo;s funny.</li>
<li>I often feel like she knows more about me than I know myself. Sometimes, we don&rsquo;t even have to say anything to communicate. I just know when she wants to grab an ice cream.</li>
<li>We have small fights to prevent big arguments. It&rsquo;s like using small fires to prevent large wildfires. Whenever I get hurt by what she says, I try to express my emotions immediately. Buddhist mentality is the way. I try my best to avoid suppressing feelings before I get consumed by anger.</li>
</ul>
