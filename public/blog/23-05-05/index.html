<h1>My First Internship</h1>
  
</p>

<main data-pagefind-body>
<content>
  <p>After getting my college degree in the US, I returned to Korea to enlist in the military.</p>
<p>When I was discharged from a 21-month service in the army, I didn&rsquo;t know what I wanted to do next. I considered preparing for LEET(Legal Education Eligibility Test) to join a law school but soon realized I had no interest in becoming a lawyer.</p>
<p>I wished for an opportunity to escape from the trench of boredom and anxiety. Using a stack of LEET prep books as a pillow, I found myself checking job postings every day. Without telling anyone, I wrote a sloppy resume and CV and sent them to a bunch of companies. A few days later, I received an offer to intern at a travel startup in Seoul.</p>
<p>The internship was incredible. The business development team I joined had the most passionate people in the company. The service was growing fast, and I could freely suggest and lead any projects. I didn&rsquo;t mind putting in extra hours because I could see I was making a difference.</p>
<p>A few weeks before my 3-month contract ended, my team leader offered me to stay in the company to work as a full-time manager. This meeting surprised me because I never thought of becoming a business manager. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I wanted to be committed to this career path. My brain was jumbled with futile questions like &ldquo;What am I good at?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What&rsquo;s my passion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I eventually made up my mind and messaged her to say I was interested. I still had to be interviewed by the company&rsquo;s CEO and COO before signing a new contract. Because my contract was ending soon, HR set up the interview on the last day of my internship.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t prepared to prove my value to the company. I didn&rsquo;t even know what I wanted to do with my life. I noticed the interviewers didn&rsquo;t have enough time to read my resume either. They asked whether I was genuinely interested in being part of the startup&rsquo;s mission. In return, I gave them half-baked answers I had overheard in a podcast.</p>
<p>I tried my best to sound smart, but everyone in the room knew I was the exact opposite.</p>
