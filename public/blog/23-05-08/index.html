  <p>A few days ago, I listened to Kevin Kelly speaking about AI and its effect on the job market. &ldquo;I still have not seen anyone who lost a job because of AI,&rdquo; he said nonchalantly. His argument stood out because other so-called experts were all screaming about the upcoming AI revolution.</p>
<p>Sure. ChatGPT passed the bar exam, and Midjourney generated some impressive text-to-image artworks. However, my life has not been impacted at all. I still bake bread, clean floors, wash dishes, and write articles. AI&rsquo;s not part of my life yet.</p>
<p>Humans are attracted to doomsday prophecies. When will the volcano erupt? When will the nuclear war begin? When will we achieve AGI? These questions are worth asking only if someone&rsquo;s trying to prevent a potential catastrophe. Otherwise, &ldquo;The world is ending anyway&rdquo; mentality is the fertile ground for helplessness and meaninglessness.</p>
<p>Talking about AI is entertaining. That&rsquo;s why the content around AI is sweeping the Internet. Nonetheless, I don&rsquo;t have to squeeze AI into my life. I just want to execute my job well.</p>
