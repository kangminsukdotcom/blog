  <p>When Tim Ferriss <a href="https://tim.blog/2023/05/11/bobby-hundreds/">interviewed</a> Korean American artist Bobby Hundreds, Tim asked a stream of questions to find out why Korean entertainment is taking over the world. Tim was in search of a magic sauce, a concise explanation for the success of Parasite, Squid Game, and BTS.</p>
<p>To answer Tim&rsquo;s questions, Bobby laid out some Korean words like <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_(cultural)">Han</a></em> and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunchi">Nunchi</a></em> to represent distinct characteristics of Korean culture. Hearing Tim&rsquo;s excitement at these &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; words, I realized Koreanness is being defined by blue-check people outside Korea.</p>
<p>Trying to blanket the entire population of Korea with these meaningless terms is like claiming all Japanese still carry the samurai spirit. I don&rsquo;t want <em>Han</em> and <em>Nunchi</em> to be the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai"><em>Ikigai</em></a> that has become a buzzword in countless self-help books.</p>
<p>Brooding upon the success of Korean entertainment won&rsquo;t provide enlightening life lessons. The rise of Korean soft power is a complicated story that deserves more than &ldquo;there&rsquo;s something different about Koreans.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>If you&rsquo;re curious about &lsquo;Han,&rsquo; read <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/against-han-or-why-koreans-are-not-defined-by-sadness">this article</a> by Minsoo Kang.</em></p>
