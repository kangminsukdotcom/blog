  <p>Because I run a restaurant, I meet both angels and assholes. Although 99% of our guests are fantastic, a few assholes still find their ways to sneak in and try to ruin the day. I wish I could always ignore them and find peace, but sometimes my feelings get scarred.</p>
<p>If hospitality means embracing assholes, I must hide my annoyance and provide my best service to everyone entering the restaurant. Even when someone vents frustration on me, I should be poised for the interaction.</p>
<p>Understanding assholes takes courage and effort. It&rsquo;s impossible to follow this path without training my brain in mindfulness. To act this way, my body must be drenched with grace and love.</p>
<p>I can also forget about serving assholes and focus on other guests. Maybe someone&rsquo;s got to face these assholes. The assholes would notice they were unwelcome, so most would never consider returning. This could be a wiser choice if I never regret treating some guests differently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dilemma.</p>
