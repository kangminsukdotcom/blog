Last weekend, my wife and I visited Seoul for the first time in about a year. We were excited to see friends and eat great Mexican food(still haven&rsquo;t found a decent Mexican restaurant in Jeju).
Although we used to live in Seoul for years, I couldn&rsquo;t stop telling myself, &ldquo;There are so many people and ads.&rdquo; I was like a robot overwhelmed with processing thousands of faces and billboards." />

  <p>Maybe humans are not meant to live in a city of 10 million people.</p>
<p>Last weekend, my wife and I visited Seoul for the first time in about a year. We were excited to see friends and eat great Mexican food(still haven&rsquo;t found a decent Mexican restaurant in Jeju).</p>
<p>Although we used to live in Seoul for years, I couldn&rsquo;t stop telling myself, &ldquo;<em>There are so many people and ads.</em>&rdquo; I was like a robot overwhelmed with processing thousands of faces and billboards.</p>
<p>Ads, especially the ones in subway stations, were selling <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagwon">hagwon</a></em> courses, cosmetics, and plastic surgeries. These images were urging all to chase popular jobs and mimic perfect-looking celebrities.</p>
<p>Can you form original ideas after reading hundreds of ad copies every day? Is it even possible to be 100% immune to these messages?</p>
