<h2 id="reason-for-writing-this-letter">Reason for Writing this Letter</h2>
<p><em>Hello Kang, it&rsquo;s Ko. It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve written a letter on a day that isn&rsquo;t a birthday or anniversary. Honestly, I can hardly remember the last time I wrote a letter after getting married&hellip; Hehe.</em></p>
<p>This is a letter of reconciliation that I&rsquo;m sending to you. As you know, when I get angry, I can&rsquo;t control myself and I end up saying hurtful things. Even after we reconcile and things get better between us, I find myself dwelling on those moments of conflict. The angry tone of my voice, the selfishness in choosing words that I knew would hurt you. Each time, I end up hating myself and worrying that I cannot grow as a person.</p>
<p>I want to ask for your help. Help me to manage my anger better, to share good feelings with you going forward. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m writing this letter of reconciliation today.</p>
<h2 id="its-more-than-who-is-right-or-wrong">It’s More Than Who Is Right or Wrong</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s something more important than figuring out who was right or wrong. This letter is about resolving negative feelings and building a positive relationship. It&rsquo;s about committing to care for each other&rsquo;s hearts and actually finding ways to do so. Protecting our relationship is all that really matters to me, and I want to make that clear to you.</p>
<h2 id="praise-gratitude-respect">Praise, Gratitude, Respect</h2>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t fought recently and our relationship is stable. It might seem strange to write a letter of reconciliation when there&rsquo;s nothing to apologize for. But that&rsquo;s exactly why I thought now was the right time. When there&rsquo;s no one seeking forgiveness, we can talk on equal footing. I wanted to focus on communication, not apologies, and I hoped this letter of reconciliation would be a good starting point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is impossible when the door of communication is open,&rdquo; as Thich Nhat Hanh says. How can I open your heart then? I thought about the words I hoped to hear from you — the words that signify praise, gratitude, and respect.</p>
<p>As I listed all of your praises, your traits I&rsquo;ve always wanted to emulate, and the coolness you possess that I lack, I realized why it hurts so much to argue with you. It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m afraid of losing someone as precious as you. Just writing down how much I love and respect you made me instantly happier.</p>
<h2 id="when-im-angry">When I&rsquo;m Angry</h2>
<p><em>Why did I act that way towards someone as precious as you?</em> I regretted the words too easily after saying them.</p>
<p>Looking back, I always thought there was a logical reason for my anger. I believed I had the right to be angry, and I thought you should apologize first. Seeing you unaware of my frustration made me even angrier. Can you see how narrow-minded I can become when I&rsquo;m angry?*</p>
<p>I chose to write a letter because I thought it was necessary to carefully convey my views before having a real-time conversation. Instead of guessing what&rsquo;s on your mind, I wanted to focus on organizing my thoughts. I felt it was more appropriate to share how I felt instead of pointing out the actions of yours that upset me.</p>
<p>As I tried to objectively reflect on myself, I wrote in detail what happened inside me when I got angry. Just as I can&rsquo;t immediately understand your actions and words during a fight, the same must be true for you. If we ever face a situation where we&rsquo;re both upset, I want you to know it&rsquo;s never because I despise you.</p>
<h2 id="promises-and-asking-for-help">Promises and Asking for Help</h2>
<p>I decided not to take the easy way out with a vague promise of mutual forgiveness. I dislike the idea of shamelessly asking you to just understand my feelings. What I need is not just a promise, but real guidelines for practical actions. To convey my strong desire to change, I needed to be specific and clear about what I&rsquo;m asking for.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try not to lash out with expressions like ‘You are annoying&rsquo; or ‘You piss me off&rsquo;. Lightening my words seems to help dissipate the anger more quickly. So, I thought about using &lsquo;I feel neglected&rsquo;. Doesn&rsquo;t that sound better? From now on, if I say &lsquo;I feel neglected&rsquo;, please try to understand why I feel that way. Just doing that will make me feel a lot better.</p>
<p>It seems there&rsquo;s a law of conservation of anger. If I keep suppressing it, it will eventually explode. Instead of holding it in until a big fight, what if we let it loose little by little? Smaller bouts of anger are easier to handle. If it seems like I&rsquo;m getting angry over trivial things, maybe I&rsquo;m trying hard not to turn this moment into a big fight. I&rsquo;ll try to calm my anger this way.</p>
<h2 id="reply-i-want-to-hear">Reply I Want to Hear</h2>
<p>In a previous letter, I wrote that we should be able to openly discuss our strategies to handle heated arguments. Fighting isn&rsquo;t a solo act. So, you and I both need to be in the same boat. This letter of reconciliation is just a starting point. If you, like me, decide to write a letter of reconciliation, you should be able to ask for a reply. Act boldly. Ask for a chance to enlighten each other.</p>
<p>*I&rsquo;m curious if you are willing to join the promise of reconciliation. I want to hear about what goes on inside your mind when you&rsquo;re angry, and if there&rsquo;s anything unsaid about our past fights.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s okay, could you write me a reply? We can also reserve a time to talk about this. Either way, I&rsquo;ll always be waiting to hear your story.*</p>
<h2 id="lets-write-a-letter-of-reconciliation">Let&rsquo;s Write a Letter of Reconciliation</h2>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be angry with you, my love. So please help me!’ Maybe conveying this simple message is all there is to reconciliation. If the other person truly cares, they&rsquo;ll take your hand and start listening. Even if you&rsquo;re ignored, or if you can&rsquo;t deliver the letter, that&rsquo;s okay. When writing this letter of reconciliation, you may notice the knots of anger loosen a bit. Forgiving and reconciling with yourself is more important than the other one’s acknowledgement. In that sense, I&rsquo;ve already achieved my goal.</p>
