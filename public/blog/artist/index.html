  <blockquote>
<p>The most important thing about art is to work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying. - Steven Pressfield</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A friend called me &ldquo;an artist.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not an artist.&rdquo; I shook my head and hands immediately as a reflex.</p>
<p>Why did I refuse to be considered an artist? I can think of a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>My art is not generating money.</li>
<li>My art is not famous.</li>
<li>Thus, I&rsquo;m not confident in my creations.</li>
</ol>
<p>I never thought I was making art professionally. To me, only people like Picasso and Kendrick were ordained as artists. I knew I had a budding desire to craft more, but I never took myself seriously.</p>
<p>I glorified the outcome, not the process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Living life as an artist is a practice. You are either engaging in the practice or you&rsquo;re not. It makes no sense to say you&rsquo;re not good at it. It&rsquo;s like saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not good at being a monk.&rdquo; You are either living as a monk or you&rsquo;re not. - Rick Rubin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My life is already filled with art. I write, record, and edit in the office until it&rsquo;s dark and quiet outside. No one forces me to sit and stare at the monitor, but I still adhere to my publication schedule. It&rsquo;s a plain fact; I&rsquo;m devoting my life to the art of storytelling.</p>
<p>I dig for inspiration when I consume other books, podcasts, and videos. I sometimes sigh when I encounter an exceptional sentence in a novel. <em>&lsquo;How can I write like this?&rsquo;</em> I get jealous of their God-given talent and worry about my embarrassing skills.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Art is not about thinking something up. It is about the opposite—getting something down. - Julia Cameron</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end, no one cares whether I&rsquo;m entitled to be an artist. There&rsquo;s no rush to tattoo &ldquo;artist&rdquo; in my bio. This inner conflict will be resolved after putting enough work in. I&rsquo;m the one who quit jobs and closed a restaurant to spend more time on art. I love being an artist and wish to stay truthful when a friend calls me so.</p>
<p>Over the next two weeks, I want to share my thoughts as I become even more invested in art-making. This will be a fun experiment. I hope to answer some questions as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is <em>creativity</em>?</li>
<li>How do I learn, express, and publish more?</li>
<li>What happens if I write morning pages every day?</li>
<li>Can I go back to being a child again?</li>
</ul>
