  <p>I get it, GPT subscribers. LLMs are getting better at emulating human consciousness. I’m also excited about the rapid advancement of AI and how it will shape the future of humanity.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean I need to consult with my computer whenever I have a burning question. ChatGPT is a tool, not my mentor. Why would I let AI-generated sentences be the guiding principles of my life?</p>
<p>Immediate solutions could only be satisfying when asking plain questions such as “Where is Korea?” There can’t be an absolute answer to multifaceted questions like “How can I make my business survive a hundred years?“AI could provide useful tips, but I must go through years of trial and error myself to learn numerous details of running a sustainable business. Complex tasks like writing a book, running a company, and maintaining relationships deserve a lifetime endeavor.</p>
<p>I refuse to be a docile student of AI-generated wisdom. Some of us are drowning in a never-ending feed of content. Consumers have already lost patience when it comes to entertainment. Should we allow another algorithm to govern our lives?</p>
<p>If you were going to Seoul for the first time, would you entrust ChatGPT as the mastermind behind your itinerary? I don’t think so. I’m sure you would prefer unique experiences over generic touristy destinations. As a first-time human, that’s how I feel about seeking life hacks through feeding prompts into a language model.</p>
<p>I want to get lost and explore the world on my own.</p>
