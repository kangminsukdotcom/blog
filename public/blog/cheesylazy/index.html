<li>We write a weekly newsletter on our <a href="https://jagunbae.com/">website</a>. We share recipes we developed and publish essays about our experience and philosophy. We&rsquo;ve written over 80 posts and currently have about a hundred subscribers.</li>
<li>We have <a href="https://reviews.cheesylazy.com">fantastic reviews on all sites</a> such as Happy Cow, Google, Naver, and Kakao.</li>
<li>Our food is fresh and original. We bake our bread twice a day and make almost all the ingredients ourselves. For example, pickles, kombucha, mayonnaise, hot sauce, romesco sauce, tofu cheese, smoked cheese, parsley pesto, teriyaki sauce, and chili are all housemade.</li>
<li>We aspire to be more than a restaurant. We&rsquo;re writing our first e-book titled &ldquo;Too Small to Fail - How to Start a Small Restaurant.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re also planning on hosting a podcast to interview independent business owners in Jeju.</li>
<li>We also update our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEnNOs6dh8HmuTkrP5Hd0rUmdjOXXVdsS">200 songs playlist</a> on a daily basis.</li>
