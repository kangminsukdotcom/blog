  <p>My <a href="https://reviews.cheesylazy.com/">1-year-old sandwich shop</a> has about a hundred reviews all over the Internet. Overall, I&rsquo;m grateful to hear honest feedback because it&rsquo;s my job to check whether my restaurant&rsquo;s providing excellent food and service.</p>
<p>However, I also meet online &ldquo;critics&rdquo; who tour restaurants to collect reviews on Instagram. When these people enter my restaurant, I can instantly tell they&rsquo;re not interested in any of our products and values. To me, they don&rsquo;t feel like customers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no smile nor &ldquo;hello,&rdquo; these people stride in and take pictures in burst mode. <em>What am I doing here?</em> I murmur while wrapping sandwiches. The food is served, and I hear the iPhone shutter until they&rsquo;re gone. They take a cab to hunt the next review. I clean up the table and leftovers.</p>
<p>In a few days, I encounter their reviews online. But no, I never see them again.</p>
