  <p>My <a href="https://reviews.cheesylazy.com/">1-year-old sandwich shop</a> has about a hundred reviews all over the Internet. Overall, I’m grateful to hear honest feedback because it’s my job to check whether my restaurant’s providing excellent food and service.</p>
<p>However, I also meet online “critics” who tour restaurants to collect reviews on Instagram. When these people enter my restaurant, I can instantly tell they’re not interested in any of our products and values. To me, they don’t feel like customers.</p>
<p>There’s no smile nor “hello,” these people stride in and take pictures in burst mode. <em>What am I doing here?</em> I murmur while wrapping sandwiches. The food is served, and I hear the iPhone shutter until they’re gone. They take a cab to hunt the next review. I clean up the table and leftovers.</p>
<p>In a few days, I encounter their reviews online. But no, I never see them again.</p>
