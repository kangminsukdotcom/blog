  <p>I’m writing a book about death. This book will be <a href="https://en.jagunbae.com/">Jagunbae</a>’s first publication.</p>
<p>I was nervous when I decided to close my restaurant to start a publisher. My heart said I was on the right path, but I wasn’t sure if my creation could be a meaningful contribution to the ever-growing space of information.</p>
<p>My mind played the same question over and over. Does the world need more books? More specifically, does the world need <em>my</em> books?</p>
<p>In South Korea, at least <a href="https://www.eroun.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=34927">60,000 titles were published in 2022</a>. <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/news/society/10482768">53% of Koreans above 18 don’t even read a single book per year</a>. In this country, books in warehouses are stacked like mountains. Clearly, people around me don’t read Laozi, Plato, and Adam Smith anymore. Shorts, gossip, and porn have replaced great books.</p>
<p>I’m not Tom Cruise, and my book is not <em>Mission Impossible</em>. If I want my book to be perused by many, I must convince readers that I crafted attention-worthy content.</p>
<p>I was thrilled to pay for books by Morgan Housel, Tim Ferriss, Derek Sivers, and Rick Rubin because I had gained so much through their previous posts and podcasts. Hearing the news of their upcoming books, I was already sold these creators were committed to helping others and presenting modern classics. Like friends supporting one another, buying these books felt like a private way of saying <em>Thank you</em>.</p>
<p>I want my readers to feel the same. I want to persuade others through consistent work and actions. Sleek copywriting and photography might pull off some sales. But having <em>a New York Times Bestseller</em> badge loses meaning if no one’s actually reading it. The grand prize for publishing a book must be the authentic connection through personal ideas and stories. That’s why I’m determined to share my rocky journey of running a publisher while writing a book.</p>
<p>If an artist comes up to me and says, <em>I’m scared because I’m not talented enough to compose music like Beethoven or Mozart.</em> I would answer <em>Come on, you haven’t even tried yet. Art is not about others. It’s about yourself.</em> Why not direct this advice to myself? The world is not waiting for my book. I can’t write prose like Ray Bradbury. My book will not be groundbreaking. Still, this book will represent who I really am. Right now, that’s enough for me.</p>
