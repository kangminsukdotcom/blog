  <p>Politicians are fighting. I‚Äôm tired of seeing feeds full of arguments, not discussions. Politicians should care about the well-being of millions, but only the individualistic and power-hungry succeed in elections.</p>
<p>In Korea, citizens become hopeful when new politicians get elected‚Äîlike watching Korea vs. Brazil in the World Cup‚Äîmost know there‚Äôs no chance of winning, but they still hope for a miracle. The same disappointment happens in politics. People get excited when politicians make rosy promises but get disappointed when they spend all their energy crushing others by any means necessary.</p>
<p>I haven‚Äôt seen a politician devoted to solving problems. Maybe the ones doing their jobs aren‚Äôt on the news. The quiet ones get forgotten, while the rowdy ones get remembered for the next election. In the end, citizens crave content, not improvements.</p>
<p>Governments are not trusted by their own people. Few believe officials, especially the president, are telling the truth. News has become entertainment. People prefer hearing stories about lies and messiahs over demanding truth and justice.</p>
<p>Elections occur, but the candidates are almost always old men who don‚Äôt even know how to code ‚ÄúHello World.‚Äù Korean students endure brutal exams for a chance to study in Seoul, but politicians aren‚Äôt tested for their suitability to lead the nation. I have nothing to say if some kid asks if there is anything to learn from our presidents. I can only say they are the most hated and corrupt people in the country.</p>
<p>We deserve better, but some kind of magic fools us again. We repeatedly elect another corrupt and egotistical maniac. Again, I dream of voting for leaders who genuinely care about the growth and well-being of everyone.</p>
