  <p>My brain can&rsquo;t function like a web browser. I need to stop running 5 different tabs in my mind.</p>
<p>I find myself getting anxious when I&rsquo;m focusing on one job at a moment. I have to listen to a podcast while walking, read an article while sipping coffee, and watch YouTube while playing with cats. It seems like my brain has learned to fake maximum productivity all the time.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t I just do one job at a time? It must be so easy to pay full attention to simple acts like walking, watching, and eating. However, it&rsquo;s painfully difficult to be 100% aware of the present moment.</p>
<p>Maybe social media is to blame, but I&rsquo;m the one responsible to take care of my mind&rsquo;s well-being. I&rsquo;m the one in charge of fixing bad habits and constructing better systems.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ve made a few promises myself to be more human and less computer-like.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop switching. Finish the job before moving on to a new one.</li>
<li>Be aware of the addiction. Notice the urge to check &rsquo;likes&rsquo; and &lsquo;comments.&rsquo; Tech products have become drugs, and I hate to be an addict.</li>
<li>Consume long-form content. My attention span should be capable of understanding a book instead of a tweet.</li>
</ul>
<p>As Anthony De Mello <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Awareness-Opportunities-Reality-Anthony-Mello/dp/0385249373">says</a>, &ldquo;You become happy by contact with reality. That&rsquo;s what brings happiness, a moment-by-moment contact with reality.&rdquo;</p>
