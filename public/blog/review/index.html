  <p>I&rsquo;ll be publishing book reviews on this blog.</p>
<p>My review will be deeply personal. There won&rsquo;t be a 5-star rating or structural analysis. I&rsquo;ll only share what I think is inspirational and interesting about the story. Nothing special, just a man&rsquo;s attempt to have a real conversation with another writer.</p>
<p>I also hope this series to help me improve my information diet. Perusing books could be the best way to forget about the endless feed of entertainment on social media.</p>
<p>Let me show you some candidates. It&rsquo;s actually a list of unread books waiting to be opened on my Kindle.</p>
<ul>
<li>1984 by George Orwell.</li>
<li>Animal Farm by George Orwell.</li>
<li>Brave New World by Aldous Huxley.</li>
<li>Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk.</li>
<li>Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.</li>
<li>I, Robot by Isaac Asimov.</li>
<li>Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith.</li>
<li>No Country for Old Men by Ernest Hemingway.</li>
<li>On the Road by Jack Kerouac.</li>
<li>Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
<li>Catch-22 by Joseph Heller.</li>
<li>The Devil in the White City by Erik Larson.</li>
<li>Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson.</li>
<li>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Hunter S. Thompson.</li>
<li>The Sympathizer by Viet Thanh Nguyen.</li>
<li>John Dies at the End by Jason Pargin.</li>
<li>Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
<li>Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.</li>
<li>The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck.</li>
<li>Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin.</li>
<li>Bear Town by Fredrik Backman.</li>
<li>Cyteen by C.J. Cherryh.</li>
<li>The Night Watchman by Louise Erdrich.</li>
<li>The Sentence by Louise Erdrich.</li>
<li>A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Tool.</li>
<li>The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand.</li>
<li>The Stranger by Albert Camus.</li>
<li>Beloved by Toni Morrison.</li>
<li>Midnight&rsquo;s Children by Salman Rushdie.</li>
<li>Oblivion by David Foster Wallace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Email me if you have any recommendations. I&rsquo;d also like to read non-fiction books, but finding one without fluff has been difficult. I recently realized reading short essays is much more effective for self-improvement. I could be wrong about this take.</p>
